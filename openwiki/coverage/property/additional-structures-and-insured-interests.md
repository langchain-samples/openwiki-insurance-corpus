# Additional Structures and Insured Interests

## Read the policy in layers

These provisions do different jobs. Coverage B classifies and limits building property. An **additional interest** receives a property-loss interest without becoming an insured. An **additional insured** receives stated liability insured status. An occupancy endorsement changes the treatment of a disclosed use; it is not, by itself, an underwriting approval. Start with the governing base-form edition and declarations, identify the attached endorsement that acts on the issue, and then apply that endorsement only to the extent its text changes the base policy.

```mermaid

    A["Identify the policy line and edition"] --> B["Classify the property or activity"]
    B --> C{"Other structure?"}
    C -->|"Yes"| D["Apply Coverage B grant and limit"]
    C -->|"No"| E{"Unit-owner building property?"}
    E -->|"Yes"| F["Apply Coverage A ownership or repair responsibility"]

    F --> H
    G --> H
    H --> I["Apply endorsement grant, exclusions, limit, and deductible"]
    I --> J["Separately check occupancy conditions and underwriting eligibility"]
```

*This flow separates property classification and endorsement application from the separate underwriting decision about whether the occupancy is acceptable.*

## Policy-line map: status, interest, and Coverage B are separate gates

Across the supplied editions, **insured status** answers who receives the policy's rights and duties; **ownership or legal responsibility** answers whose property obligation is being insured; **insurable interest** limits whether and how much that person may recover; and **Coverage B** answers whether the item is a qualifying other structure. A person can have an interest in property without being an insured, and a qualifying structure can still fail a use, location, peril, or limit test. Do not carry a percentage, ownership predicate, or attached-property rule from one line into another.

| Line and edition | Coverage B and building boundary | Ownership and insurable-interest boundary | Adjacent property/status boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DP-3 2026-01** | Coverage B is **15% of Coverage A** for other structures set apart by clear space or connected only by a fence, utility line, or similar connection and used for a purpose related to the residence premises. It expressly addresses construction, temporary removal, fences, paved surfaces, detached garages, storage structures, and permanently installed equipment. [DP-3 2026-01 B.1–B.24](repo://forms/DP/MS/DP-3/2026-01.md#L291-L408) | The agreement requires an insurable interest at the time of loss, limits payment to the insured's financial interest, and says coverage does not create ownership. DP-3 B.20–B.21 then limits an other-structure payment to the insured's ownership, legal responsibility, and insurable interest. [DP-3 2026-01 AGR.1–AGR.6](repo://forms/DP/MS/DP-3/2026-01.md#L14-L35) · [DP-3 2026-01 B.20–B.21](repo://forms/DP/MS/DP-3/2026-01.md#L378-L390) | “Insured” status is defined separately for you and qualifying household residents; a tenant, boarder, or nonqualifying employee is not an insured merely because that person occupies or uses the premises. Coverage C likewise requires an insurable interest in personal property. [DP-3 2026-01 DEF.4–DEF.7](repo://forms/DP/MS/DP-3/2026-01.md#L87-L109) · [DP-3 2026-01 C.1–C.2](repo://forms/DP/MS/DP-3/2026-01.md#L410-L420) |
| **HO-4 2021-10** | Coverage A is expressly not provided. Coverage B nevertheless covers other structures on the residence premises that are set apart or connected only by a fence, utility line, or similar connection, when owned or legally the insured's responsibility. The cited B.1–B.8 text supplies no Coverage B percentage; use the issued policy and declarations rather than importing HO-3 or HO-5's percentage. [HO-4 2021-10 A.1–A.27](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-4/2021-10.md#L71-L125) · [HO-4 2021-10 B.1–B.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-4/2021-10.md#L127-L143) | HO-4's agreement applies only to property in which the insured has an insurable interest and pays no more than that financial interest. Its Coverage C includes insured-owned or insured-used personal property and tenant improvements or building additions, alterations, fixtures, and installations when the insured has an insurable interest and the property is not otherwise insured. [HO-4 2021-10 AGR.1–AGR.4](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-4/2021-10.md#L13-L23) · [HO-4 2021-10 C.1–C.9](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-4/2021-10.md#L193-L213) | HO-4 defines insured status separately from property interest: qualifying household residents are insured, while a nonqualifying tenant, boarder, or roommate is not. A structure's location on the residence premises does not create Coverage A or automatically convert contents into building property. [HO-4 2021-10 DEF.4–DEF.6](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-4/2021-10.md#L49-L55) · [HO-4 2021-10 A.3–A.4](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-4/2021-10.md#L75-L81) |
| **HO-5 2022-06** | Coverage B is **10% of Coverage A** for other structures on the residence premises. Separation by clear space or a limited fence, utility-line, or similar connection distinguishes B from attached dwelling property. The form covers specified private, storage, workshop, construction, temporary-removal, and limited rental uses, but excludes business, lodging, most rental, and commercial uses. [HO-5 2022-06 B.1–B.19](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-5/2022-06.md#L185-L223) | HO-5 covers the insured's dwelling additions, alterations, and improvements when owned or required to be insured by written agreement. For B, it does not cover a structure the insured does not own unless there is a duty to insure it, and it remains subject to the insured's insurable interest. [HO-5 2022-06 A.1–A.9](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-5/2022-06.md#L107-L125) · [HO-5 2022-06 B.20–B.22](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-5/2022-06.md#L225-L231) | HO-5's agreement limits property coverage to the insured's financial interest. Coverage C is **50% of Coverage A**, covers property owned or used by the insured, and separately recognizes the insured's interest in jointly owned property and legally responsible custody of another's property; it does not make the other person's interest the insured's. [HO-5 2022-06 AGR.1–AGR.7](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-5/2022-06.md#L13-L29) · [HO-5 2022-06 C.1–C.5 and C.36–C.40](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-5/2022-06.md#L257-L267) · [HO-5 2022-06 C.36–C.40](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-5/2022-06.md#L329-L337) |
| **HO-3 2024-03** | Coverage B is **10% of Coverage A** for qualifying other structures at the residence premises. The form separates a detached structure from the dwelling by clear space or only a fence, utility line, or similar connection and treats an attached structure as dwelling property unless that limited connection applies. [HO-3 2024-03 B.1–B.6](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L155-L167) | HO-3 B.3 requires ownership or a manner of holding that gives the insured an insurable interest; B.19–B.20 limits a jointly owned or liened structure to the insured's interest and legally entitled payment rights. [HO-3 2024-03 B.3 and B.19–B.20](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L161-L163) · [HO-3 2024-03 B.19–B.20](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L191-L195) | HO-3 Coverage A covers attached structures and tenant-responsibility building property, while the definition of insured remains a separate status rule. [HO-3 2024-03 A.1–A.7](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L97-L113) · [HO-3 2024-03 DEF.4–DEF.5](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L57-L65) |
| **HO-6 2023-02** | Coverage B uses the same clear-space or limited-connection classification and residential-use boundary, but its supplied B section states no percentage. Its rental, business, land, storage, and customer-use exclusions must be applied as written rather than borrowing HO-3 or HO-5 limits. [HO-6 2023-02 B.1–B.9 and B.27–B.30](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L134-L152) · [HO-6 2023-02 B.27–B.30](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L186-L194) | Coverage A, not B, covers unit building property owned by or legally the responsibility of the unit owner, including attached components and governing-document responsibilities. The 2023-02 B section does not state the HO-3 ownership predicate, so do not invent one; apply the policy's actual declarations, agreement, and other applicable terms. [HO-6 2023-02 A.1–A.20](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L78-L118) · [HO-6 2023-02 B.1–B.9](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L134-L152) | HO-6 insured status and Coverage A property responsibility remain distinct. Attached fixtures, improvements, and association-allocation facts require the governing documents and policy edition; a master policy or unit location alone does not establish the unit owner's coverage. [HO-6 2023-02 DEF.4–DEF.5](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L46-L60) · [HO-6 2023-02 A.16–A.20](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L108-L118) |

The percentages above are not interchangeable: DP-3 2026-01 uses 15%, HO-3 2024-03 and HO-5 2022-06 use 10%, and the supplied HO-4 and HO-6 B sections do not state a percentage in the cited provisions. A declarations limit or attached endorsement may still control, but no form edition should be assigned another line's percentage by analogy.

A reliable review uses this order:

1. Select the form edition from the policy record and read the declarations.
2. Classify the item as Coverage B, Coverage A unit-owner building property, Coverage C personal property, Coverage D loss of use, or liability exposure.
3. Name the acting endorsement before describing its effect: the endorsement **modifies** the attached policy within its stated scope and **preserves** nonconflicting base-form terms.
4. Apply the endorsement's grant, exclusions, conditions, limit, and deductible; do not treat a topic match or a base-form cross-reference as proof that the endorsement is attached.
5. Separately complete the occupancy, state, and underwriting review.

## Coverage B baseline: other structures

For **HO-3 2024-03**, Coverage B covers an “other structure” on the residence premises. It must be separated from the dwelling by clear space, or connected only by a fence, utility line, or similar connection. The base limit is **10% of Coverage A**. The structure must be owned by you or held in a manner that gives you an insurable interest and must be used in connection with the residence premises. The base form excludes business use and business-property storage, farming or livestock uses, manufacturing or distribution, land and natural property, and business-related hazardous-material storage. [HO-3 2024-03 B.1–B.13](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L153-L181)

For **HO-6 2023-02**, Coverage B also requires a structure set apart from the dwelling by clear space or connected only by a fence, utility line, or similar connection, and its supplied section states no Coverage B percentage; use the applicable policy limit rather than importing the HO-3 10% rule. The section excludes land and natural property, structures rented or held for rental to another person (unless occupied by you for a residential purpose), business structures and business storage, and structures serving goods for sale or customers. It does **not** state the HO-3 ownership or insurable-interest wording in the cited Coverage B provisions. [HO-6 2023-02 B.1–B.30](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L134-L194)

These are classification boundaries, not merely limit reductions. An endorsement can change a limit or provide a stated use or property grant, but it does not turn personal property, land, an attached structure, or otherwise excluded property into covered property unless the endorsement expressly changes that result.

### Attached features and the coverage-part boundary

Ownership or legal responsibility answers **whose interest is being evaluated**; it does not by itself select the coverage part. The physical relationship and the form's property description do that work:

| Property fact | Coverage-part treatment in the supplied forms |
|---|---|
| A structure attached to the dwelling beyond a fence, utility line, or similar connection | It is part of the dwelling rather than Other Structures under HO-3 2024-03. HO-6 2023-02 likewise treats attached additions and structures as Coverage A property. [HO-3 2024-03 B.2](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L157-L165) · [HO-6 2023-02 A.1–A.5](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L78-L88) |
| Permanently installed fixtures, equipment, additions, or alterations that are part of a qualifying detached structure | They remain part of that Coverage B structure in HO-3 2011-05 and HO-6 2023-02. Movable property merely stored in or attached to the structure is not converted into Coverage B by its location. [HO-3 2011-05 B.8–B.14](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2011-05.md#L137-L149) · [HO-6 2023-02 B.22–B.26](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L178-L186) |
| Land, soil, plants, landscaping, or natural material at a detached structure | It is not Other Structures coverage; the structure itself must be separated from the land analysis. [HO-3 2024-03 B.10](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L173-L177) · [HO-6 2023-02 B.27](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L186-L188) |
| Joint ownership or a lien affecting an HO-3 2024-03 other structure | The form recognizes the insured's insurable interest and does not pay beyond that interest; a lien does not itself expand the Coverage B limit. [HO-3 2024-03 B.19–B.20](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2024-03.md#L193-L195) |

The 2011 HO-3 wording also keeps the lifecycle of a qualifying structure in the Coverage B analysis: a structure under construction, materials at the residence premises, permanent additions and fixtures, and a structure temporarily removed or in transit for repair can remain within the stated Coverage B treatment, while permanent relocation or use elsewhere ends the stated temporary treatment. Those provisions do not cover a business structure, undamaged property, or duplicate payment. [HO-3 2011-05 B.11–B.18](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2011-05.md#L143-L157)

Read ownership, attachment, use, and cause of loss as separate questions. A mortgage, additional interest, condominium document, or claim description may identify a payee or responsibility, but cannot by itself move property from Coverage C to Coverage B, from Coverage B to Coverage A, or from an excluded category into coverage.

## Acting property endorsements

### HO 04 48: increased Coverage B limit

**Acting endorsement and modification.** When attached to an HO-3 policy, **HO 04 48 (2026-06) modifies Coverage B's limit** to **20% of the Coverage A limit**, replacing the otherwise applicable limit. It applies only to covered direct physical loss to qualifying Other Structures and does not increase Coverage A or create coverage for property that is not otherwise covered. [HO 04 48 attachment and scope](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L13-L27) · [HO 04 48 W.1.1–W.1.5](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L29-L47) · [HO 04 48 W.2.1–W.2.4](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L129-L137)

**What the limit does not do.** The increased limit does not change the property to which Coverage B applies, erase a cause-of-loss exclusion, or combine with another coverage limit. The endorsement controls only where it conflicts with another applicable provision; all other terms, conditions, exclusions, and duties remain applicable. [HO 04 48 W.0](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L13-L27) · [HO 04 48 W.2.20–W.2.22 and W.4.1–W.4.3](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L67-L73) · [HO 04 48 W.4.1–W.4.3](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L201-L207)

**Limit and condition.** The 20% amount is the most payable under Coverage B for covered loss; it does not increase because multiple structures or other interests are involved. For a loss from the same occurrence, the endorsement applies one combined deductible to covered property damage and covered expenses rather than a separate deductible per item. Coverage must be established before the deductible is applied; the deductible cannot make excluded property or loss covered. [HO 04 48 W.2.1–W.2.3](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L129-L135) · [HO 04 48 W.3.1–W.3.7](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-48/2026-06.md#L179-L193)

### HO 04 40: structures rented to others

**Acting endorsement and modification.** The HO-3 2011-05 base form excludes an other structure rented or held for rental to a non-tenant, subject to its private-garage exception. When attached, **HO 04 40 (2011-05) modifies that rental-structure treatment** by providing a property grant for a separate structure on the residence premises that is rented or held for rental to another person. It covers the insured's interest in direct physical loss caused by a covered cause of loss, permanently installed fixtures and equipment, additions and alterations, and insured-owned repair materials. [HO-3 2011-05 B.1–B.10](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-3/2011-05.md#L139-L163) · [HO 04 40 W.1.1–W.1.12](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-40/2011-05.md#L41-L65)

**What it preserves.** The structure must remain on the residence premises. The endorsement does not cover the dwelling, ordinary personal property, liability, or loss-of-use claims. It preserves exclusions for unlawful use, flood and surface water, earth movement, sewer or sump backup, vacancy-related vandalism, tenant or occupant property, business pursuits, and repeated seepage or leakage. Tenant property does not become covered merely because it is in or near the rented structure. [HO 04 40 W.1.13–W.1.17 and W.1.34–W.1.37](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-40/2011-05.md#L67-L75) · [HO 04 40 W.4.1–W.4.15 and W.4.29–W.4.42](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-40/2011-05.md#L247-L277) · [HO 04 40 W.4.29–W.4.42](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-40/2011-05.md#L303-L333)

**Limit and condition.** Landlord's furnishings have a **$5,000** maximum. The limit applies regardless of the number of items damaged or the number of occurrences causing the loss. The insured must be able to show that the structure was rented or held for rental at the time of loss; the endorsement may request rental agreements, rent records, and tenant communications. [HO 04 40 W.2.1–W.2.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-40/2011-05.md#L141-L165) · [HO 04 40 W.1.46–W.1.49](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-40/2011-05.md#L131-L139)

## Property interests are not insured status

### HO 04 10: additional interest

**Acting endorsement and modification.** When attached, **HO 04 10 (2011-05) modifies the policy's treatment of an identified additional interest**. It recognizes a person or organization with a lawful financial interest in property at the residence premises when identified in an acceptable manner. It provides coverage only for that interest in covered property and only when the policyholder has an insurable interest at the time of loss. Recognition does **not** make the additional interest an insured, transfer ownership, or give it the policyholder's rights and duties. [HO 04 10 W.0.1–W.0.17](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-10/2011-05.md#L13-L47) · [HO 04 10 W.1.1–W.1.6](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-10/2011-05.md#L49-L61)

**What it preserves.** The additional interest cannot recover more than its lawful interest or recover for property, perils, liability, penalties, assessments, or obligations that are not otherwise covered for the policyholder. An invalid, unenforceable, fraudulent, fictitious, transferred-after-loss, or ended interest is not covered. [HO 04 10 W.1.17–W.1.24](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-10/2011-05.md#L81-L97) · [HO 04 10 W.4.44–W.4.67](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-10/2011-05.md#L415-L461)

**Limit and condition.** There is no separate limit unless expressly provided. Payment may be joint or direct once the interest is established, but every payment reduces the same applicable limit and the maximum is the lesser of the covered loss, that limit, or the additional interest's financial interest. The additional interest must cooperate, provide evidence, permit inspection, and preserve recovery rights. [HO 04 10 W.2.1–W.2.14](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-10/2011-05.md#L161-L189) · [HO 04 10 W.1.7–W.1.16](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-10/2011-05.md#L61-L81)

### HO 04 41: additional insured

**Acting endorsement and modification.** When attached, **HO 04 41 (2011-05) modifies the liability section** by giving the scheduled person or organization insured status only with respect to the residence premises. It provides coverage for covered bodily injury or property damage liability arising from ownership, maintenance, or use of that premises, including a defense to a covered suit. [HO 04 41 W.0](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-41/2011-05.md#L13-L55) · [HO 04 41 W.1.1–W.1.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-41/2011-05.md#L57-L73)

**What it preserves.** The endorsement does not provide property insurance for the additional insured. It also preserves boundaries for liability unrelated to the residence premises, business or professional services, intentional or criminal acts, vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and damage to property owned by, occupied by, or in the custody or control of the relevant insured. The additional insured has no greater rights than the policy provides and cannot change, cancel, or direct the policy merely because it is scheduled. [HO 04 41 W.0.21–W.0.37](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-41/2011-05.md#L99-L137) · [HO 04 41 W.1.57–W.1.60](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-41/2011-05.md#L171-L177)

**Limit and condition.** The applicable liability limit is shared by the covered loss; the number of insureds, claims, persons making a claim, or occurrences does not increase it. The additional insured must promptly notify us and forward demands, notices, summonses, or legal papers. The additional insured must report changes in ownership, transfer, use, or occupancy; insureds separately owe the cooperation and evidence duties stated in the endorsement. [HO 04 41 W.1.41–W.1.52](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-41/2011-05.md#L139-L161) · [HO 04 41 W.2.1–W.2.19](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-41/2011-05.md#L215-L253)

## HO 04 42: permitted incidental occupancies

**Acting endorsement and modification.** When attached, **HO 04 42 (2011-05) modifies liability and property treatment for a permitted incidental occupancy** conducted by an insured at premises used in connection with the residence. The occupancy must be subordinate to residential use, lawful, and not materially change the premises' residential character. The endorsement provides stated liability coverage for bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury arising from an occurrence connected with that occupancy, and its limit clause addresses covered property used in the occupancy. [HO 04 42 W.1.1–W.1.7](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L35-L49) · [HO 04 42 W.2.1–W.2.10](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L135-L155)

**What it preserves.** The endorsement does not cover an unpermitted, materially different, unlawful, non-residential, or off-premises occupancy, or a business other than the permitted occupancy. It also excludes many higher-hazard or specialized exposures, including professional and medical services, care for a fee, products and completed work, entrusted or customer property, vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, animals, food and alcohol, pollution, employment practices, and cyber or data risks. [HO 04 42 W.4.1–W.4.7](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L257-L271) · [HO 04 42 W.4.13–W.4.44](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L283-L345)

**Limit and condition.** The supplied endorsement text does not state a dollar amount for its “applicable limit”; it defines that limit as the most payable for covered property and says the limit is not increased by the number of insureds, claims, locations, or items. It also expressly does not increase the other-structures, contents, ALE, or debris-removal percentages. The insured must conduct only the activity described in the applicable schedule, maintain required licenses and approvals, notify material changes, keep records, and permit inspection. [HO 04 42 W.2.2–W.2.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L137-L151) · [HO 04 42 W.4.8–W.4.12](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L273-L281) · [HO 04 42 W.5.1–W.5.12](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L377-L405) · [HO 04 42 W.6.1–W.6.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-04-42/2011-05.md#L471-L489)

## HO-6 unit-owner arrangements

### Condominium master-policy gap: operational review, not a legal conclusion

The condominium training is useful for claim and underwriting fact-gathering, not for deciding coverage or ownership as a legal matter. Start with the association declaration, the association master policy, the unit-owner policy, and any written assessment or repair direction. Identify the damaged component, who owns it or must repair it under the governing documents, the cause of loss, and which policy is being asked to respond. A visible location inside the unit is not enough to classify the property, and a master-policy claim, repair decision, or assessment does not itself establish HO-6 coverage. [Condominium training L.2.2–L.2.8](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L61-L91) · [Condominium training L.2.31–L.2.37](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L181-L207) · [Condominium training L.2.51–L.2.63](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L261-L311)

Separate the source of damage from the property damaged. A common element or shared pipe may cause damage inside a unit without making the association responsible for every affected item. Split common property, unit building property, improvements, personal property, tenant property, mitigation, and loss of use before applying policy language. Obtain the declaration, master-policy position, photographs, repair scope, invoices, association records, and assessment notice when those facts matter. [Condominium training L.2.13–L.2.20](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L109-L139) · [Condominium training L.2.45–L.2.50](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L237-L259) · [Condominium training L.2.57–L.2.66](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L285-L323)

### Rental unit: HO 17 32

**Acting endorsement and modification.** When attached to the applicable HO-6 policy, **HO 17 32 (2014-04) modifies the unit-owner property treatment while the unit is rented or held available for rental**. It covers the owner's permanently installed property, appliances, furnishings, equipment, improvements, maintenance property, and qualifying property of others for which the owner is legally responsible. It also provides loss of rent when a covered loss makes the unit unfit, but tenant personal property is not covered merely because it is in the unit. [HO 17 32 W.0](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-32/2014-04.md#L13-L39) · [HO 17 32 W.1.1–W.1.22](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-32/2014-04.md#L41-L85)

**Limit and condition.** The landlord's-furnishings limit is **$5,000**, is part of Coverage C, and applies regardless of the number of items damaged or the number of occurrences causing the loss. It does not become a separate limit merely because the claim also involves loss of rent or other interests. The insured must provide rental agreements, rent records, or tenant communications when reasonably requested to show that the unit was rented or held available at the time of loss. [HO 17 32 W.2.1–W.2.10](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-32/2014-04.md#L139-L159) · [HO 17 32 W.1.47–W.1.48](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-32/2014-04.md#L131-L137)

The endorsement does not replace the need to read the governing HO-6 edition and declarations. Its attachment modifies only the rental treatment stated in the endorsement and preserves the policy provisions it does not change.

### Unit-owner building property: Coverage A boundary

The HO-6 2023-02 base form covers building property that the unit owner owns or is legally responsible for, including attached additions, permanently installed components, and property assigned to the owner under governing documents or an agreement. It excludes property placed solely under the association's responsibility. Coverage B is a separate classification for structures set apart from the dwelling; in the supplied B section, do not import an unstated ownership predicate or a Coverage A percentage. [HO-6 2023-02 A.1–A.5 and A.16–A.20](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L78-L118) · [HO-6 2023-02 B.1–B.9](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L134-L152)

Do not use Coverage B to solve a unit-owner building-property question. A unit's attached fixtures, improvements, and building property that the owner must insure belong in the Coverage A analysis, subject to the applicable edition, agreement, exclusions, limit, and deductible. The condominium training's ownership and repair questions help gather facts; the HO-6 wording controls the contractual result. [HO-6 2023-02 A.1–A.13](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-6/2023-02.md#L78-L120) · [Condominium training L.2.31–L.2.42](repo://training/condo-master-policy-gap.md#L181-L223)

### HO 17 33: Coverage A special coverage

**Acting endorsement and modification.** When attached to the 2014-04 HO-6 policy, **HO 17 33 modifies Coverage A**, not Coverage B. It covers direct physical loss to eligible Coverage A property on a risk-of-direct-physical-loss basis and sets a **$25,000 Coverage A limit**, subject to its deductible, exclusions, and conditions. It does not make association master-policy property automatically covered. [HO 17 33 W.1.1–W.1.5 and W.1.6–W.1.22](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-33/2014-04.md#L39-L81) · [HO 17 33 W.2.1–W.2.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-33/2014-04.md#L137-L153)

The endorsement preserves exclusions for earth movement, flood or surface water, groundwater, and sewer or sump backup, among others. Its $25,000 Coverage A limit is not a master-policy limit and does not create Coverage B or loss-assessment coverage. [HO 17 33 W.1.6–W.1.10](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-33/2014-04.md#L51-L59) · [HO 17 33 W.2.1–W.2.8](repo://forms/HO/MS/HO-17-33/2014-04.md#L137-L153)

## Occupancy coverage is not underwriting eligibility

HO 04 42 can modify the contract when attached, but it does not override internal appetite rules. The Texas homeowners guideline permits binding only when detached structures are safe, maintained, and incidental to residential use. [Texas homeowners appetite H.1.19–H.1.27](repo://guidelines/appetite/tx-homeowners.md#L97-L113) Internal underwriting guidance separately requires referral for business activity from the insured location and says not to classify activity as incidental without referral authority approval; it also requires confirmation that incidental business activity does not materially increase property or liability exposure. [Underwriting manual 310.Q](repo://manuals/underwriting/manual.md#L4505-L4515) · [Underwriting manual 510.11–510.12](repo://manuals/underwriting/manual.md#L6289-L6299)

For a detached structure used for business, the manual says to refer rather than assume that the structure is incidental to residential use. For professional services, client meetings, product storage, or business production, it likewise requires referral where the use is not incidental to residence. Those are eligibility and authority controls, not changes to what HO 04 42 means. [Underwriting manual 530.G–530.I](repo://manuals/underwriting/manual.md#L6893-L6909)

### Practical claim and underwriting checklist

1. Identify the DP-3, HO-3, HO-4, HO-5, or HO-6 edition, declarations, deductible, and attached endorsements.
2. Classify the item: Coverage B other structure, Coverage A unit-owner building property, personal property, or liability exposure.
3. For Coverage B, test the form's separation, ownership or insurable-interest wording (if any), location, use, and base exclusions before applying an increased-limit or rental endorsement.
4. For a condominium loss, obtain the declaration, master-policy position, repair responsibility, and assessment or repair records before classifying the damaged component.
5. For an additional interest, verify the lawful financial interest and its extent; for an additional insured, verify that the requested protection is liability status limited to the endorsed premises.
6. For an occupancy, compare the actual activity with the schedule and endorsement conditions, then apply the endorsement's exclusions and limits.
7. Separately complete the applicable state and underwriting referral review. Attachment of an endorsement does not waive referral, inspection, licensing, or appetite requirements.
